My project, Certibot, aims to revolutionize the process of generating automated course completion certificates for students. By leveraging the power of UIPath StudioX, Certibot streamlines the certification process, eliminating the need for manual intervention.Through a user-friendly interface, students can effortlessly obtain their certificates. Once generated, Certibot seamlessly sends the certificates to the students' designated email addresses, ensuring quick and efficient delivery. With Certibot, the certification process becomes a hassle-free experience for both students and administrators, saving valuable time and resources.
